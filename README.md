My Custom VSCode theme. Color pallet based on Lucy and David. Uses pastels throughout, with slightly more vivid pastels in the editor to keep you focused.
This is my first time making something like this so I know there are going to be certain feature/colors missing so consider this to be in beta. 

Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.

**Enjoy!**
